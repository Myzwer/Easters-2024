 * Footer SCSS
 * ---------------------------
 * This is the scss file to control the styles of the footer.
 * Most of the "settings" are at the top, but dig around to change more specific things.
 * The Color settings are at the top, but any other specific edits will need scss editing.
 * This does follow mobile first design, so to edit tablet +, make sure you edit past the media query.
